# Slack Magic-8-ball
_« Beseech and thou shall hath an answer »_

A Node.js server for [Slack](https://slack.com/) that randomly responds to trigger words on a channel, and changes behavior depending on who posts.

Copy `config.json.dist` to `config.json` and `messages.js.dist` to `messages.js` and make the relevant changes with your domain, api key and payload token, then add some messages, and you're ready to go !
